  "faqs-payments-1": "Do Gather trips have a cost? How much does a trip cost?",

  "faqs-payments-2": "How are the estimated costs for a trip calculated?",
  "faqs-payments-2-answer": "The estimated costs are generated by the driver that creates the trip, the driver might use our suggestions to know the distance of the trip and calculate the costs based on this.

  "faqs-payments-3": "Why are only the cost of fuel used and tolls considered?",
  "faqs-payments-3-answer": "The cost of fuel and tolls are the only costs that are considered in the calculation of the estimated costs of the trip, this is because these are the only costs that are shared between the driver and the passengers. The cost of the driver's time is not considered because it is not shared between the driver and the passengers. Be aware than a driver can define Extra Costs that are shared between the driver and the passengers. The Extra Costs are not considered in Gather suggestions for the calculation of the estimated costs of the trip as they depend on what the Driver will do on the trip. If you have doubts about the Extra Costs in a trip, ask the driver about them.",
