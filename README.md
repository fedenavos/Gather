# GatherðŸš—

Gather's mission is to promote sustainable transportation and reduce environmental impact by connecting individuals for carpooling arrangements.

## Description

This website allows users to join or create shared carpool trips to save money, meet new people, and help the environment by reducing traffic. It provides a platform for individuals traveling to the same location to connect and share the cost of the trip. The goal of the website is to promote carpooling as a cost-effective, social, and environmentally-friendly transportation option.

The main functionalities of the website are the following:

- CRUD (create, read, update, delete) functionality for trips, vehicles, and accounts.
- Trips filtering: Users can filter trips by various criteria (e.g. origin/destination, date, number of seats available, smoking/kids/pets, etc.)
- Creation of private trips that are only accessible with an invite code, allowing them to travel with a specific group of people.
- Personal reviews and driver score: Users can leave anonymous reviews and ratings of their carpooling experiences with their drivers, and drivers have a score calculated based on these reviews. This helps to establish trust and ensure that users feel comfortable carpooling with others on the platform.
- Estimated time and distance of a trip using Google Maps APIs, helping users to plan and coordinate logistics.
- Well-designed and professional-looking homepage that provides a clear overview of the carpooling service, as well as an FAQs page to answer common questions and concerns.
- Multiple languages support to make the website accessible to a wider audience
- User profiles, where users can view and edit their personal information.

## Tech Stack

For this project, I utilized a tech stack that included **NextJS** with **React** and **Node.js** on the front and back ends, respectively. I used **PostgreSQL** as the database, and **Prisma** as the ORM to facilitate the interaction between the application and the database.

To host the database, I utilized **Railway**, and for website hosting, I used **Vercel**.

For the user interface, I employed a combination of **React Bootstrap**, **MaterialUI** and custom CSS inside **CSS modules**.

To ensure secure authentication, I implemented **NextAuth** with login through Github, Google and Facebook.

To ensure high-quality code, I utilized **Sonarcloud** and **Lighthouse** for code analysis.

Overall, this tech stack allowed me to build a robust and scalable application that meets the needs of users and performs well under a variety of conditions. It was a great opportunity for me to learn and gain experience with a wide range of technologies and tools.
